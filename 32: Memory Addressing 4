Structures:
A way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable is known as a member.
Ex:
struct student{       // Structure declaration
    char name[10];    // Member (char variable)
    int age;          // Member (int variable)
    char grade;
};                    // End with semicolon 


To access the structure, you create a variable inside the main
struct student s1;

Now you need to fill out the details of this variable
s1.age = 10;
s1.grade = 'A';
strcpy(s1.name, "Kevin");

OR

struct student s2 = {"Tay", 24, 'A'};

But this way you need to be careful of the order.
You can get around this using this method

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct student{       // Structure declaration
    char name[10];    // Member (char variable)
    int age;          // Member (int variable)
    char grade;
};                    // End with semicolon 


int main(){
	struct student s3 = {
		.name = "Poppy",
		.age = 25,
		.grade = 'B'

	};

	printf("s3 name %s", s3.name);

return 0;
}


Understand memory alignment and padding.
