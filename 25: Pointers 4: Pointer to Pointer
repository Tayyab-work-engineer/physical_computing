Pointer to pointer:
A pointer which points to another pointer.
ex;
int x=5;
int *p;
p=&x; //contains address of x

int **q;
q = &p; //points to address p

Uses?
They are used in the dynamic memory allocation of multidimensional arrays. (create dynamic 2D array)
They can be used to store multilevel data such as the text document paragraph, sentences, and word semantics.
They are used in data structures to directly manipulate the address of the nodes without copying.
They can be used as function arguments to manipulate the address stored in the local pointer.



void pointers:
Is a pointer that has no associated data type with it.
It can hold an address of any type and can be typecasted to any type.

ex;
int a = 10;
char b = 'x';

void *p = &a;
p = &b;
//printf("%c",*p); ERROR
printf("%c",*(char*)p);

Adv:
1. malloc() and calloc() return void * type and this allows these functions to be used 
to allocate memory of any data type (just because of void *).
2. void pointers in C are used to implement generic functions in C. 
For example, compare function which is used in qsort().




pointer arrays:
A pointer array is a homogeneous collection of indexed pointer variables that are 
references to a memory location.
Uses?
When we want to point at multiple memory locations of a similar data type.
Then we can access the data by dereferencing the pointer pointing to it.

ex:
int var1 = 10;
int var2 = 20;
int var3 = 30;

int* ptr_arr[3] = { &var1, &var2, &var3 };
printf("%d\n",*ptr_arr[1]);


Use for char:
char *arr[5] = { "gfg", "geek", "Geek", "Geeks", "GeeksforGeeks" }

Normally we predefine the size of array. This leaves some space as empty.
char str[3][10] = { "Geek", "Geeks", "Geekfor" };

We can use array to fix this
ex:
char* arr[] = { "geek", "Geeks", "Geeksfor" };
// Print each string and its address
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("%s\n", arr[i]);
}

// Print addresses of each string
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("Address of arr[%d]: %p\n", i, (void*)arr[i]);
}

Here, the total memory used is the memory required for storing the strings and 
pointers without leaving any empty space hence, saving a lot of wasted space
