Introduction To multithreading

How to create threads?
1. add pthread library ( #include <pthread.h> )
2. create the variable name to store the thread, ( pthread_t thread; )
3. link it to a function ( pthread_create(&thread, NULL, wait, NULL); )
4. join the thread ( pthread_join(thread, NULL); )


Example code:
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* foo(void* arg) {
    printf("Thread created");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread1;
    pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, foo, NULL);

    pthread_join(thread1, NULL);
    return 0;
}

How programs are executed in C?
Normally code will run only run one instruction at a time.
So line by line.
Some computers have multiple cores so they can run multiple code simultaneously.
However 
Concurrency
B


processes vs threads.
