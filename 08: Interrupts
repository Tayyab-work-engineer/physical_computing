Circuit set up is 5v on pd2. By taking it in and out, it will switch the built in led.
code:
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>

ISR(INT0_vect){
	//toggle LED
	PORTB ^= (1<<PB5);
}

int main(void)
{
	DDRB |= (1<<PB5);
	PORTB = 0x00;

	DDRD = 0xFF;

	//Set to trigger on change in logic level
	EICRA |= (1<<ISC00);

	//Enable interrupt
	EIMSK |= (1<<INT0);

	sei();

	while(1);
}
