Shared memory and race conditions â€” explain and demonstrate.

When multiple threads are run, they share the same memory space.
	pthread_t thread1,thread2;

	pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, foo, (void*)"Thread1 is running");
	pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, foo, (void*)"Thread2 is running");

They can introduce challenges such as race conditions, when multiple threads access
and modify the same data simultaneously.
