What are debug memory issues:
Memory leaks are when memory is being used and onces it finishes its left without being freed.
This can eventually lead to memory being filled up and lead to crashes.

Common causes are when you forget to deallocate using the free function. 

Debug memory issues using tools like valgrind (on Linux):
Valgrind is a open source framework for debugging and profiling Linux applications.

How to use?
1. Compile your program
2. Run valgrind against your compiled program (only works for linux)
valgrind --show-leak-kinds=all ./c
