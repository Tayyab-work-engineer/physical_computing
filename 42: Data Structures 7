I am going to use stacks to store what tasks I have.
ID | Complete | Task
1  | X        | Daily C program
2  |          | Review C program


I am going to use queues to store the order I want to do the task.
Queues use a FIFO. So the first task I enter should be the first task I do, 
then the second task I enter should be the second task that I want to do.
