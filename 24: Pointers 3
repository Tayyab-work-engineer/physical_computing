Dynamic memory allocation
allocating memory at the runtime of a program.
Use? One you declare an array, and its size then you cannot change it. However,
Sometimes the size of the array you declared may be insufficient. To solve this issue, you can
allocate memory manually during run-time.


malloc()
Stands for memory allocation. This reserves a block of memory of a specified number of bytes.
And leaves the memory uninitialized
ex;
ptr = (float*) malloc(100 * sizeof(float));
Size of float is 4 bytes. So allocates 400 bytes of memory. The pointer ptr holds the address of the
first byte in the allocated memory.


calloc()
Stands for contiguous allocation. Allocates memory and initializes all bits to zero.
ex: 
ptr = (float*) calloc(25, sizeof(float));
Allocates contiguous space in memory for 25 elements of type float.

realloc()
If the dynamically allocated memory is insufficient or more than required, 
you can change the size of previously allocated memory using the realloc() function.
ex;
ptr = realloc(ptr, x);
ptr is reallocated with a new size x.


deallocation with free()
Frees the space allocated in the memory.
ex;
free(ptr);
