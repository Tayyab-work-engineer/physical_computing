Introduction To multithreading

How to create threads?
1. add pthread library ( #include <pthread.h> )
2. create the variable name to store the thread, ( pthread_t thread; )
3. link it to a function ( pthread_create(&thread, NULL, wait, NULL); )
4. join the thread ( pthread_join(thread, NULL); )


Example code:
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* foo(void* arg) {
    printf("Thread created");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread1;
    pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, foo, NULL);

    pthread_join(thread1, NULL);
    return 0;
}

How programs are executed in C?
Normally code will run only one instruction at a time. So line by line.
Some computers have multiple cores so they can run multiple code simultaneously.
However some programs can make use of concurrency. They run multiple functions at the same
time. Each line is run in turn from the different functions.

Concurrent Programming?
Allows a program to perform several tasks simultaneously instead of having to wait for the result of 
one operation to move onto the next. The operating system itself uses this concept to meet its users expectations. 
If we had to wait for a song to finish to be able to open our browser, or if we had to restart the computer to 
kill a program caught in an infinite loop, we’d die of frustration!

Processes vs Threads.
A process is a program in execution. A single program can create many processes when run multiple times; 
for example, when we open a .exe or binary file multiple times, multiple instances begin (multiple processes are created).

A thread is a logical sequence of instructions inside a process that is automatically managed by the operating system’s kernel. 
A regular sequential program has a single thread, but modern operating systems allow us to create several threads in our programs, 
all of which run in parallel.
