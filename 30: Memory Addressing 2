Explore memory layout: 
refers to how the programâ€™s data is stored in the computer memory during its execution. 
A C program's memory is organised into specific regions(segments).
Layout: From low address to high address
Text Segment(code), Initialised Data(Static/Global), Uninitialised Data(bss)(Static/Global), Heap(), Stack(Function calls/local variables).

stack:



heap, 


Static/global memory



Code segment.


Question: WHat happens in the memory when this program is executed? Stack segment, Global segment
#include <stdio.h>

int total;

int Square(int x)
{
    return x * x;
}

int SquareOfSum(int x, int y)
{
    int z = Square(x + y);
    return z;
}

int main()
{
    int a = 4, b = 8;
    total = SquareOfSum(a, b);
    printf("output = %d", total);
}
