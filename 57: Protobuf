Learn what Protocol Buffers are and why they’re used in embedded systems.

What is Protocol buffers?
turn your code into binary which saves space.
Is a method for serializing structured data. 
Ex:
Lets say your temperature sensor is connected to your arduino. You want to send its data
to another system such as mobile app, a web server, a PC dashboard or another microcontroller 
over UART,SPI, Bluetooth?
You want to send this data:
Temperature = 25.6
Unit = "C"
Timestamp = 1721318400

Why Send This Data?You might want to:
1. Log it to an SD card or cloud
2. Display it on a dashboard
3. Trigger alarms or decisions (e.g. temperature too high)
4. Share with other devices in a smart home or IoT network

But before sending it, you need to package it in a structured format. 
You will need to define a clear structure using .proto and finally
Using Protocol Buffers, 
your serialised code might look like this:
0D 33 33 CC 41 12 01 43 18 80 C2 D7 CB 06
This is binary data, not human-readable. Size: Around 14 bytes

Why they’re used in embedded systems.
