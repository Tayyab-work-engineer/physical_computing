Understand how variables are stored in memory:
Memory can be considered an array of bytes where each address is an index in the array and holds 1 byte. 
When you declare a variable in a C program, the C compiler allocates a random memory location to it, 
depending on the size requirement, which depends on the type. Ex:
int var1 = 10;
The compiler assigns the value in a random byte address. Since an int type needs 4 bytes, the next four addresses are earmarked for it.


intro to memory addressing.
Modern computer systems use a combination of registers, cache memory, and RAM (Random Access Memory) for storing variables, 
with each level having different access times and storage capacities. 
The management of memory is a critical aspect of computer architecture and software development, 
as efficient memory usage can have a significant impact on a programâ€™s performance.
