Implement bubble sort :
What is bubble sort?
It is a sorting algorithm that has a O(n^2) complexity that puts a list
into increasing or decreasing order.
For increasing order:
It compares adjacent elements and if a[j] > a[j+1], it will move the first
element infront of the second element. It will keep comparing the adjacent
elements until the end of the list. Then it will go around again until the whole length
or until it goes around and there were no swaps.

Ex: 5, 2, 7, 1
1 Round:
2, 5, 7, 1
2, 5, 7, 1
2, 5, 1, 7

2 Round:
2, 5, 1, 7
2, 1, 5, 7
2, 1, 5, 7

3 Round:
1, 2, 5, 7
1, 2, 5, 7
1, 2, 5, 7

Make the code better:
Ex: 5, 2, 7, 1
1 Round:
2, 5, 7, 1
2, 5, 7, 1
2, 5, 1, 7
(3 times)

2 Round:
2, 5, 1, 7
2, 1, 5, 7
// STOP not need for : 2, 1, 5, 7
(2 times)

3 Round:
1, 2, 5, 7
(Stop)
(1 time)

Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <stdbool.h>

void bubbleSort(int a[], int n){

	for(int i=0;i<n-1; i++){ //i goes up to n-1 because
		
		bool swapped = false;
		for(int j=0;j<n-i-1; j++){ //j goes up to n-i-1 because
			if(a[j] > a[j+1]){
				int temp = a[j+1];
				a[j+1] = a[j];
				a[j] = temp;
				swapped = true;
			}

		}
		if (swapped == false)
			break;

	}
}

int main(){

	int arr[] = {4, 2, 5, 3, 1};
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

	bubbleSort(arr, n);

	for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
		printf("%d ", arr[i]);
	}
	return 0;

}


Implement selection sort.

You have unsorted elements on the left hand side and 
sorted elements on the right.
The program goes through the array and selects the smallest
element in the remaining unsorted list and swap it at the current
index.

Ex: 5, 2, 7, 1

Select 5 as the index.
The program goes through each element and finds the smallest which is
1 and will swap it with the 5.

   1, 2, 7, 5
   |
Sorted


1, 2, 7, 5
   |
 sorted

1, 2, 5, 7
      |
     sorted

1, 2, 5, 7
Finish.

Code:  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YepJ7fDmyjI)
void selectionSort(int a[], int n){
	for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
		int index = i; //index to swap

		for (int j=i+1;j<n;j++){

			if(a[j]<a[index]){
				index = j;
			}

		}

		if (index !=i){ //if index does change the
			int temp = a[index]; //index = j
			a[index] = a[i];
			a[i] = temp;

		}

	}

}


Some explanation:
for this part 
int index = i; //index to swap

		for (int j=i+1;j<n;j++){

			if(a[j]<a[index]){
				index = j; //index will keep holding the smallest value
			}

		}
        //a = {5, 3, 4, 1, 2}
        //after loop index = 3
        //then you swap 5 with 1.
