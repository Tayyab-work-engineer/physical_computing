ðŸ”§ Mini Project: Dynamic Array Operations Menu (Using Pointers)
ðŸ§  Objective:
Create a menu-driven C program that lets the user manipulate an integer array using pointers. 
The user can perform various operations dynamically:

âœ… Features to Implement:
Insert a new element at a given index
Delete an element at a given index
Display the array
Find the maximum and minimum values
Reverse the array
Calculate sum and average
Exit the program

ðŸ”— Core Concepts You'll Use:
Pointer arithmetic (*(ptr + i))
Dynamic memory management (malloc, realloc, free)
Passing arrays to functions via pointers
Menu system using a while loop and switch-case

ex:
Enter the number of elements: 4
Enter elements:
1 3 5 7

Choose an operation:
1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Display
4. Find Max/Min
5. Reverse
6. Sum/Average
7. Exit
Choice: 1

Enter index and value to insert: 2 10

Array after insertion: 1 3 10 5 7



Final Code:
