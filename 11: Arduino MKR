I have got a new arduino board called Arduino MKR
I will be working with arduino IDE because I want to improve my C++ skills.

First I will get used to the arduino IDE and I will be re making the projects from before
such as:
1. Button
2. Transmitting and Receiving
3. PWM with Servo
4. Potentiometer
5. Making the Robotic ARM.
